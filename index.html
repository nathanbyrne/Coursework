				I am currently in 1st year at Robert Gordons University, Aberdeen
				studying Computer Science. From an early age l realised l wanted
				a job in the computing industry. I was introduced to computer
				games at a young age and this first sparked my interest and 
				passion. Computing was always my favourite subject at both 
				primary and secondary school.  During my time at college l studied a wide range of computing
				aspects such as Programming, Databases, Web Design and Java 
				Scripting.
				<br></br>
                <br></br>				
				I find programming gives me an exciting challenge, my mind is always
				eager to take on the tasks programming presents me with.  
                When browsing the web, l find myself analysing websites, 
				thinking of how l could personally improve the aspects of each
				site such as design or navigation.
