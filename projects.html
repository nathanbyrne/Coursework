				I am currently in 1st year at Robert Gordons University, Aberdeen
				studying Computer Science.From an early age l realised l wanted
				a job in the computing industry. I was introduced to computer
				games at a young age and this first sparked my interest and 
				passion. Computing was always my favourite subject at both 
				primary and secondary school.

			<h3> Project 1 - Travel Blog </h3> <!-- Subtitle -->
                <p><!-- Content of Page -->
                l started travelling in September 2016 and l have spent time in 11 countries
				across Europe in the last 6 months. The point of my travel blog is to write about 
				my experiences on the road, what l enjoyed, what l didn't enjoy but mainly to look
				back on my great memories. The blog could also be used for fellow travellers who are 
				looking for tips on travelling, what to do in the country and to get a good idea and 
				opinion about what the experience will be like.

               The point of starting this project was to give my voice and opinion on everything relating 
			   to the world of video games. This blogs contains, previews, reviews and just anything newsworthy 
			   within the video game industry. l also implemmted a scroll feed at the side of the blog, which would be 
               updated with new video game purchases l had made recently.
